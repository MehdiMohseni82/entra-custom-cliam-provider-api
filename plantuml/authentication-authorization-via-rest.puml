User -> FE : Open app
FE -> SSO : Redirect for login
User -> SSO : Enter credentials
SSO -> User : Issue JWT token
User -> FE : Return to app with token

FE -> AZ : Request permissions (with token)
note right of FE
(1) Permissions must be requested on almost every call.\nRisk: if skipped, users can manipulate their access.
end note

FE -> BE : Call API (send token)
BE -> BE : Validate token

BE -> AZ : Request permissions (with token)
note right of BE
(2) Duplicate permission check in backend.\nThis adds latency and is repeated for every request.
end note

BE -> BE : Look up permissions result
BE -> FE : Respond with allowed features/permissions

note over FE,BE
(3) Two sources of truth:\nThe token (for authentication) and a separate call for permissions (authorization).\nThis breaks the "token as single point of truth" principle.
end note

FE -> User : Render app based on permissions
