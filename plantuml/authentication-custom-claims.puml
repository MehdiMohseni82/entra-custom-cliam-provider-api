User -> FE : Open application
FE -> Entra : Request login (OIDC/SAML)\n(via AppReg)
Entra -> User : Show login page
User -> Entra : Enter credentials
Entra -> CCP : Call custom claim provider\n(authenticated using CCPReg)
CCP -> Entra : Return custom claims
Entra -> FE : Issue ID Token (with custom claims)
FE -> FE : Use ID Token for API calls, etc.

note right of Entra
Entra validates CCP endpoint using its own\nApp Registration (CCPReg) and includes claims\nfrom the CCP response in the issued token.
end note

note right of FE
The frontend app (and backend, if needed)\ncan now access the custom claims from\nthe ID Token.
